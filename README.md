==================
This project is my entry for the Hack the Arduino Robot competition (http://www.robotchallenge.org/competition/).

In June 2012, I build an automatic shirt-folding robot. In January 2014, I entered the Hack the Arduino Robot competition (http://www.robotchallenge.org/competition/) to try and win a free Arduino Robot. For the competition, I submitted the following paragraph describing what I would do if I won the robot:
“A couple of years ago, I built an Arduino-powered shirt-folding machine which folds clothes. Using the Arduino robot from the RobotChallenge, I will build a device to remove folded clothes from the machine and to stack them. My idea is special because it will involve two Arduinos (the Arduino Uno in the shirt folder, and the Arduino robot) which will have to communicate, and because it will be very useful. The robot will solve the real life problem of laundry folding by making the task easier and faster and by doing so nicely; the robot will use a custom-designed gripper to transport garments while keeping them perfectly folded.”
I won the robot and am now implementing my project.

The purpose of the project is to create an automatic shirt-stacking robot to go with the automatic shirt folding robot that I already have. The shirt stacking robot picks up a shirt from the shirt folder and then places the shirt into a pile.

This git repository contains all of my files for both the original shirt-folding robot along with the files for the shirt-stacking robot.
